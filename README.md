Tournament 3
-------------
Back to basics NCAA march madness basketball pool software implemented in pure C for speed.
No nonsensical bit twiddling.  40.2M bracket scores per second. 

Implemented as a single file header for command line pool management.
This may change at some point, not sure what benefit this has as
the use case I was thinking of no longer applies.

Building
--------

Run

```console
$ ./build.sh
$ ./pool -h
```

Build script uses value of CC environment variable or `cc` if it is not set
as the compiler.

Use clang:

```console
$ CC=clang ./build.sh
```

Tested on Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Windows 11 (MinGW), Windows 11 (WSL) and Mac OS X (M1).

Running a Pool
--------------
You can use this software to run your office or friend group NCAA pool.

1. Create a directory on your computer to hold the pool files.
1. Create the `config.txt` file and set your pool's name, scoring method
   and round multipliers.
   1. If you are running this pool for profit, also fill in the `fee`
      and `payouts` lines.
   1. The `fee` is the number of currency units you collect per entry.
   1. The `payouts` line is a comma separated list of no more than
      4 integers which specify the payouts by rank.
      1. positive numbers specify a percentage of the total fees collected
      1. -1 specifies that rank gets the entry fee back.
      1. The sum of the percentages has to equal exactly 100
   1. [Sample `config.txt` file](https://seifertd.github.io/tournament3/2024/config.txt)
1. Create the `teams.txt` file in the directory.
   1. Each line is in the form "Long Name,3-character Short Name"
   1. Each team must have a unique short name. 
   1. The short names are case sensitive.
   1. For the four play in games, use `PI1`, `PI2`, `PI3` and `PI4` as the
      short name. The long name is irrelevant.
   1. The order of teams listed is as follows: top left region first, bottom left region second,
      top right region third, bottom right region fourth. The left side plays the right side
      in the championship. Within each region, teams are in order of seed as follows:
      1, 16, 8, 9, 5, 12, 4, 13, 6, 11, 3, 14, 7, 10, 2, 15
   1. Lines starting with a '#' character are considered comments and ignored
   1. [Sample `teams.txt` file](https://seifertd.github.io/tournament3/2024/teams.txt)
1. Collect entries
   1. You can hand out forms, set up a pool on one of the free websites
      or send out the included bracket HTML entry collector page via email.
   1. The HTML entry collector needs to be edited with the current year's
      teams.
      1. New for 2024: there is a ruby script to generate the web entry collector
         from the teams file. You need a working ruby install and can run it as
         follows: `ruby web/make_bracket.rb ./2024/teams.txt ./web/2024_bracket.html ./2024/logo.uri`
         * 1st argument: the location of the generator script in this repo
         * 2nd argument: the location of the teams file
         * 3rd argument: location where to save the bracket
         * 4th argument: the location of a logo image file in urldata format.
   1. Here is what the HTML entry collector looks like: [Latest NCAA Tournament Bracket](https://seifertd.github.io/tournament3/web/2024_bracket.html)
1. Create the `entries` subfolder and copy/create/save any entry files you
   got from the pool entrants. 
1. Generate an entries report and send it out to everyone for confirmation:
   `./pool -d mypool entries`
1. Handle the play in games.
   1. As the play in games are played, add to
      the pool `config.txt` file lines that map the place holder short
      team names (`PI[1234]`) with a new short name matching the winner.
      You will end up with lines like:
      ```
      PI1=Wag
      PI2=Cdo
      PI3=GrS
      PI4=CSt
      ```
   1. Make sure to change the long name of the play in teams in the
      `teams.txt` file, but don't modify the `PI[1234]` short names.
1. As games are played in the tournament, record the winners in the 
   `results.txt` file, one team short name per line. For play in games,
   you can use either the original `PI[1234]` short names or the mapped
   short names of the play in games from the step above.
   1. [Sample `results.txt` file](https://seifertd.github.io/tournament3/2024/results.txt)
1. Run the scores report: `./pool -d mypool scores` until the first round
   is complete.
1. Run your first possibilities report as soon as your machine
   can handle it: `./pool -d mypool poss` and pass
   around the results via email, slack, discord or whatever.
1. When the final four teams are determined, run the Final Four
   report to show all top 4 standings and payouts (if configured) for
   each of the remaining possibilities: `./pool -d mypool ffour`

Scorers
-------
The pool configuration specifies the scorer to use in the pool.
Each scorer uses as input the bracket being scored, the round number
and the game number. In addition to the scorer, the pool configuration
specifies 6 round multipliers that the scorer can use. The default
multipliers are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
These are the supported scorers:

1. Basic: each correct pick is worth a constant amount - the
   round multiplier configured for that round.
1. Upset: each correct pick is worth the round multiplier
   for the game's round plus the seed number of the winning team.
1. SeedDiff: each correct pick is worth the round multiplier
   for the game's round plus the difference in seeds of the 
   winning team and the losing team. The bonus points only 
   apply if the loser was picked correctly and the winner's
   seed is greater than the loser's seed.
1. RelaxedSeedDiff: each correct pick is worth the round multiplier
   for the game's round plus the difference in seeds of the 
   winning team and the losing team. The bonus points only 
   apply if winner's seed is greater than the loser's seed.
   This differs from SeedDiff in that the loser in the game
   need not have been picked correctly.
1. JoshP: each correct pick is worth the round multiplier
   for the game's round multiplied by the seed number of the
   winning team.

The choice of scorer can affect the performance of the pool
possibilities report.

We want to generate all possible outcomes and score all the entries
against them. Set up a DFS with inputs:
* games - array of game numbers remaining
* gamesLeft - size of this array
* game - game in games array under review
* stats - array of stats structs, one per entry
  * maxRank, minRank, maxScore, timesWon, timesTied, possibleScore, champCounts[], bracket
  * possibleScore is set to current bracket score given state of tournament so far

Algo:
1. Initial setup as above
1. Determine the two teams in games[game]
1. Assume winner is the first team, calculate gameScore for each entry, add
   to possibleScore = possibleScore + gameScore
1. Recurse with game += 1. If game == gamesLeft, sort stats by possiblScore and update stats for this result, stop recursion.
1. Subtract the gameScore from step 2 from each possibleScore of each entry
1. Repeat 2-5 with winner assumed to be second team

max recursion depth would be = number of games remaining

Parallelization of Possibilities Report
---------------------------------------
We can parallelize the above to a power of 2 processes/servers/cores/etc if the
current tournament bracket is advanced and the algo run from there, then results
collected and combined.

2 runners:
  * 1st runner assumes game 1 winner is team1
  * 2nd runner assumes game 1 winner is team2

4 runners:
  * 1st runner assumes game 1 winner is team1, game 2 winner is team1
  * 2nd runner assumes game 1 winner is team2, game 2 winner is team1
  * 3nd runner assumes game 1 winner is team1, game 2 winner is team2
  * 4th runner assumes game 1 winner is team2, game 2 winner is team2

8 runners:
  * 1st runner assumes game 1 winner is team1, game 2 winner is team1, game 3 winner is team1
  * 2nd runner assumes game 1 winner is team2, game 2 winner is team1, game 3 winner is team1
  * 3nd runner assumes game 1 winner is team1, game 2 winner is team2, game 3 winner is team1
  * 4th runner assumes game 1 winner is team2, game 2 winner is team2, game 3 winner is team1
  * 5th runner assumes game 1 winner is team1, game 2 winner is team1, game 3 winner is team2
  * 6th runner assumes game 1 winner is team2, game 2 winner is team1, game 3 winner is team2
  * 7th runner assumes game 1 winner is team1, game 2 winner is team2, game 3 winner is team2
  * 8th runner assumes game 1 winner is team2, game 2 winner is team2, game 3 winner is team2

etc

Example run with 8 processes, collecting results into binary files in the pool directory:

```console
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -b 0 -n 8 -f bin poss &
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -b 1 -n 8 -f bin poss &
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -b 2 -n 8 -f bin poss &
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -b 3 -n 8 -f bin poss &
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -b 4 -n 8 -f bin poss &
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -b 5 -n 8 -f bin poss &
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -b 6 -n 8 -f bin poss &
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -b 7 -n 8 -f bin poss &
```

When `-f bin` is used, a binary file with partial stats is written to the pool directory.
The partial stats file names are `poss_N_of_M.bin`.

After producing the files (possibly on different machines), collect them into the
pool directory, then generate the possibilities report:

```console
./pool -d test/fifty_entries -r poss
```

Using this method and a compute cloud of 8,192 machines, we can generate a possibilities
report after Day 1 is complete in less than 1 hour. LOL.

On a single machine, the best you are going to be able to do is generate the report
in less than 1 hour by running 8 processes once there are about 38 teams remaining.
